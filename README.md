# Modified-Adventure-Game
This is a game made as part of Course Work for the course CSC207 at the University of Toronto Mississauga. This was a group assignment and it was built using the Assignment 2 code that was provided in the course. This project adds a range of assesibility features to the game such as Text to Speech, Enlarge text, Dark and Light mode and also adding the ability to augement the screen size (maximize and minimize screen). The Text to Speech feature uses a third party library/API to make it work. Furthermore, the game uses a variety of design patterns and SOLID principles within the code.
